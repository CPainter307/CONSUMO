Argument 0: Character being animated
Argument 1: Animation being played
Argument 2: Speed at which animation is played
Argument 3: Character x movement
Argument 4: Speed at which Character moves on x axis
Argument 5: Character y movement
Argument 6: Speed at which Character moves on y axis

Right now, code only really works if you only move x or y. You CAN technically move the y position at the
same time, but if it's at a faster or slower speed, once the first axis movement finishes, the second one
will be cut off before it can finish, because my programming is crap lol.
